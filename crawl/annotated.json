In general, slow methods are used in traditional vinegars where fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of a few months or up to a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a non-toxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria.

(1\u20131.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.\r\n\r\nOxtail is a bony, gelatin-rich meat, which is usually slow-cooked as a stew[1] or braised. It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Traditional preparations involve slow cooking, so some modern recipes take a shortcut using a pressure cooker. Oxtail is the main ingredient of the Italian dish coda alla vaccinara (a classic of Roman cuisine). It is a popular flavour for powder, instant and premade canned soups in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Oxtails are also one of the popular bases for Russian aspic appetizer dishes (\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446 or \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c), along with pig trotters or ears or cow \"knees\", but are the preferred ingredients among Russian Jews because they can be Kosher.\r\n\r\nVersions of oxtail soup are popular traditional dishes in South America, West Africa, China, Spain [2] and Indonesia. In Chinese cuisine, it's usually made into a soup called \u725b\u5c3e\u6c64 (ni\u00faw\u011bi t\u0101ng, \"oxtail soup\"). In Korean cuisine, a soup made with oxtail is called kkori gomtang (see gomguk). It is a thick soup seasoned with salt and eaten with a bowl of rice. It can be used as a stock for making tteokguk (rice cake soup). Stewed oxtail with butter bean or as main dish (with rice) is popular in Jamaica, Trinidad, and other West Indian cultures. Oxtail is also very popular in South Africa where it is often cooked in a traditional skillet called a potjie, which is a three-legged cast iron pot placed over an open fire. Oxtail is also eaten in other southern parts of Africa like Zimbabwe and served with sadza and greens. In the United States, oxtail is a mainstay in African American and West Indian households. In Cuban cuisine, a stew can be made from oxtail called rabo encendido. In the Philippines, it is prepared in a peanut based stew called Kare-kare. In Iran, Oxtail is slow-cooked and served as a substitute for shank in a main dish called Baghla-Poli-Mahicheh which is prepared with rice, shank (or oxtail) and a mixture of herbs including dill, coriander, parsley and garlic.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, oxtail has the meat-cutting classification NAMP 1791.", "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Oyster Sauce", "description": null, "measurement": "ml"}, {"name": "Paccheri Pasta", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Paella Rice", "description": "Paella[a] is a Valencian rice dish that has ancient roots but its modern form originated in the mid-19th century in the area around Albufera lagoon on the east coast of Spain, adjacent to the city of Valencia. Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.\r\n\r\nTypes of paella include Valencian paella, vegetable paella (Spanish: paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de mariscos), and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta), among many others. Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken, duck and rabbit), white beans (garrof\u00f3n), snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil.", "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Paneer", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pappardelle Pasta", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Paprika", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Parma Ham", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Parmesan", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Parmesan Cheese", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Parmigiano-reggiano", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Parsley", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Passata", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Peaches", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Peanut Brittle", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Peanut Butter", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Peanut Cookies", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Peanut Oil", "description": null, "measurement": "ml"}, {"name": "Peanuts", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pears", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Peas", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pecan Nuts", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pecorino", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Penne Rigate", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pepper", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pilchards", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pine Nuts", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pink Food Colouring", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pinto Beans", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pitted Black Olives", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Plain Chocolate", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Plain Flour", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Plum Tomatoes", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pork", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Potato Starch", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Potatoes", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Prawns", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pretzels", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Prosciutto", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Puff Pastry", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Pumpkin", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Raisins", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Rapeseed Oil", "description": null, "measurement": "ml"}, {"name": "Raspberries", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Raspberry Jam", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Raw King Prawns", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Chile Flakes", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Chilli", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Chilli Powder", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Food Colouring", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Onions", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Pepper", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Pepper Flakes", "description": null, "measurement": "g"}, {"name": "Red Snapper", "description": "The northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) is a species of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean including the Gulf of Mexico, where it inhabits environments associated with reefs.

All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers. This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about 39 cm (15 in). The common adult length is 60 cm (24 in), but may reach 100 cm (39 in). The maximum published weight is 38 kg (84 lb), and the oldest reported age is 100+ years. Coloration of the northern red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays.
