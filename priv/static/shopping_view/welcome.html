  You made it to the disgusting part of Alastair. Somehow this app needs to know what the prices are for the ingredients, so it can calculate a price for you. Pray to god someone already copied all the prices from a nearby supermarket, otherwise you are up for some serious fun now. If you want to see the shopping list, go to the event page you want to see it for.
